This app only supports Android currently. To track how long you have been in quarantine for:

1. Download and install the .APK from the most recent release.
2. Open the "Quarantine Time" app.
3. Select "Set start date" and choose a starting date.
4. You're all set. The date/time will automatically save and update to accurately track the elapsed time.

### Note: 
- Elapsed time is based on the current date and time.
- Pressing the elapsed time will toggle the format to include years/months or only show days.
- Start date can be fully reset in the top right options menu.
